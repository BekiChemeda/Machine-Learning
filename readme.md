This repository contains the source code and documentation for my Machine Learning projects. Each project focuses on a specific algorithm or technique and includes a detailed explanation of the implementation, dataset used, and evaluation metrics. You can find the projects organized in separate folders, each with its own README file for guidance.
Most of the time I add notes and comments within the code to explain the logic and steps taken during the implementation. You can take that as a learning resource or reference for your own projects.
Feel free to explore the projects, and if you have any questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to reach out!
