This topic is all about Linear Regression, a fundamental algorithm in machine learning used for predicting a continuous target variable based on one or more input features. Linear Regression assumes a linear relationship between the input variables (features) and the output variable (target).

In this topic, I have implemented a simple Linear Regression model from scratch using Python and currently, I am working on Multiple Linear Regression, which involves multiple input features.

The difference between Simple Linear Regression and Multiple Linear Regression is that Simple Linear Regression uses one independent variable to predict the dependent variable. You can take [Salary Predictor](https://github.com/BekiChemeda/Machine-Learning/tree/main/LinearRegression/Salary-Prediction) Project as an example of Simple Linear Regression which predicts the salary based on years of experience only. which means it has only one feature.

On the other hand, Multiple Linear Regression uses two or more independent variables to predict the dependent variable. For example, predicting house prices based on features like size, number of bedrooms, location, etc. In this case, there are multiple features involved in making the prediction.

The other difference is that Simple Linear Regression can be visualized with a straight line on a 2D graph, while Multiple Linear Regression requires higher-dimensional space for visualization due to multiple features.

The other thing is that there are some assumptions that need to be met for both types of Linear Regression. These assumptions are:
1. Linear relationship: There should be a linear relationship between the independent and dependent variables.
2. Independence: The residuals (errors) should be independent of each other. which means that the value of one observation should not influence or be influenced by another observation.
3. Homoscedasticity: The residuals should have constant variance at every level of the independent variables. which means that the spread of the residuals should be consistent across all levels of the independent variables.
4. Normality: The residuals should be approximately normally distributed.
5. No multicollinearity (for Multiple Linear Regression): The independent variables should not be too highly correlated with each other. which means that no independent variable should be a perfect linear function of one or more other independent variables. for example, if you have two features like "age" and "years of experience," they should not be perfectly correlated. We can check for multicollinearity by taking one independent variable as a function of another independent variable and calculating the R-squared value. If the R-squared value is high (close to 1), it indicates multicollinearity. using the r-squared value we can also check the tolerance and Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) to detect multicollinearity. A low tolerance value (below 0.1) or a high VIF value (above 10) indicates multicollinearity among the independent variables. formula for tolerance is 1 - R² and for VIF is 1 / tolerance. If we detect multicollinearity, we can address it by removing one of the correlated independent variables or by combining them into a single variable either through averaging or creating an index.
